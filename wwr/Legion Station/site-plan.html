      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Star Wars legion is one of the top selling miniature games out on the market right now. It pits two armies from the Star Wars universe in an epic battle. There are many websites out there that do different things, such as an army builder, tournament organizer or synergizes tool. The website I want to create compiles all these ideas into one singular website where Veterans and new players can come and use it no matter what level they play at.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is going to be the main page of my website. Star Wars legion is a tabletop miniature game where different armies from the Star Wars universe come and fight each other in epic conflicts. There are 4 factions or armies you can chose which are, The Galactic Empire, The Rebel Alliance, The Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance. Each faction has their strengths and unique characteristics and are a blast to play. People who are new to the game will be wondering what faction they should play and why, this will also be a page where it gives a breakdown of each faction and what makes them unique and why the reader should play them. This can apply to new players who want to get to know what legion all is about and maybe invest in an army, or veteran players looking to expand their current collection.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        In this sub page it will be filled with different ideas on how to play the game. This will apply to new and old players alike, where new players are trying to learn more about what strategies would be interesting to them and how veterans can find new ways to run their existing armies. Each article will be carefully written and provide list ideas for the people reading the section to apply right away.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Lots of times people who play legion come to focus on the hobby aspect of the game. I know personally quite a few people who have the most fun with just painting their miniatures and focusing more on the creative side of the hobby. I would like to create a second sub page where people are able to see spotlighted hobbyistsâ€™ projects. This will be good for new players to find inspiration and ideas to improve their painting and hobbling skills while veterans can find ideas for their next army to paint. Either way, players will be able to enjoy more of the artistic side of legion by visiting this page.
